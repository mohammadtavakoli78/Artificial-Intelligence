## Introduction
This is a project which is implemented with python, we should complete a simple sudoku and the algorithm used is ```backtracking```.<br>
I used ```MRV``` and ```LCV``` algorithms for hueristic and ```Forward Cheking``` and ```MAC``` for Constraint Propagation.<br>
Puzzle rules are as follows:
> 1. Number of 1's and 0's in each row and column must be equal
> 2. Each row and column must be unique
> 3. There should be no more than two duplicates in each row and column
