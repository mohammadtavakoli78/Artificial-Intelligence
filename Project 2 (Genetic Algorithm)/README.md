## Introduction
This is a project which is implemented with python, we learn a game and play new levels successfully. The algorithm used is ```genetic``` algorithm.<br>
Mario can jump, go straight or dodge. Mario must jump over Goomba and must dodge when it reaches Lakito. If Mario jumps 2 step before Goomba it can kill Goomba and then it gets more points. If Mario jumps when it reaches at the end of the board it gets more points (but it's adjustable). If Mario jumps on a Goomba it gets additional points.<br>
I used ```MRV``` and ```LCV``` algorithms for hueristic and ```Forward Cheking``` and ```MAC``` for Constraint Propagation.

This is a sample output of the project:<br><br>
