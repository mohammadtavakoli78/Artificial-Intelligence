## Introduction
This project is a game implemented with python and there is a gui, for this game i used search algorithms like: ```IDS```, ```BBFS``` and ```A*```. In this game a robot should push butters to their plates and the robot should do this optimally with no extra moves.<br>

This is a sample output of the project:<br><br>
